        Oh, it's like that, I'm your dream come true
        <br>
        When it's on a platter for you, hmm
        <br>
        Then you pulled back when I try to make plans
        <br>
        More than two hours in advance, mmm
    </p>

    <p>
        I slam the door, I hit ignore
        <br>
        I'm saying, "No, no, no, no more"
        <br>
        I got you blocked, after this, an afterthought
        <br>
        I finally cut you off
    </p>

    <p>
        I feel so much lighter like a feather with you off my mind (ah...)
        <br>
        Floating through the memories like whatever, you're a waste of time (ah...)
        <br>
        Your signals are mixed, you act like a bitch
        <br>
        You fit every stereotype, "Send a pic"
        <br>
        I feel so much lighter like a feather with you out my life
        <br>
        With you out my life
    </p>

    <p>
        Like a feather, like a feather, like a feather, yeah
    </p>

    <p>
        It feels so good
        <br>
        Not caring where you are tonight
        <br>
        And it feels so good
        <br>
        Not pretending to like the wine you like
    </p>

    <p>
        I slam the door (slam the door), I hit ignore (hit ignore)
        <br>
        I'm saying, "No, no, no, no more"
        <br>
        I got you blocked, excited to never talk
        <br>
        I, I'm so sorry for your loss
    </p>

    <p>
        I feel so much lighter like a feather with you off my mind (ah...)

        With you out my life

    <p>
        ah, mm
        <br>
        Like a feather, like a feather, like a feather
    </p>

    <p>
        You want me? I'm done
        <br>
        You miss me? No duh
        <br>    
        Where I'm at, I'm up where I'm at
        <br>
